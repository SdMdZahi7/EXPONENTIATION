# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find the exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: Syed Muhammed Zahi 
#RegisterNumber:21004029
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a**b
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",c)
*/
```

## Output:
